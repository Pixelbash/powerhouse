Sofresh Theme
================

Since I now work for myself and as such owe nuffink to nobody, I decided it's finally time to release my wordpress framework to the wild. This is a BLANK theme in the vein of starkers, which means it includes a hell of a lot of tricks but nothing in the way of actual styles / theme files. It is what you make it, and more than likely you will only need / want the sections that apply to your workflow. That's totally fine with me.

It uses LESS, is totally responsive when used right (converted a theme from static to responsive in <2 hours the other day), borrows some of bootstrap, and it includes (aka plugins baked in) a theme options framework & rilwis metabox among other things. I have included my own version of vt_resize which resizes images on the fly and puts them in a subfolder, meaning you can now find and delete all those images you cached while trying to get the image size just right (without having to regenerate the damn things). It also includes an image filter function (set to seipiafy but can do just about anything), a simple way to make custom post types, and a system that imports all the theme options into the main javascript file.


Please note
-----------

I have created this theme by taking my latest job and stripping out anything site specific. This means it will probably not work 100% straight out of the box. You can either let me know using issues or wait until I use this theme in my next project.
